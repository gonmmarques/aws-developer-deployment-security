## Code used to complete the AWS Developer: Deployment and Security

The scope of the course is to know more about effectively deploying applications to AWS and securing your AWS infrastructure.. It was built on AW services like:
- CloudFormation
- Elastic Beanstalk
- Simple Workflow
- Virtual Private Cloud
- CloudWatch
- CloudTrail
- Key Management Service
- Identity and Access Management


For more info check the [AWS Developer: Deployment and Security course on Pluralsight.com](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-developer-deployment-security). 

I highly recommend this course if you are getting started (like me on) the AWS world!
